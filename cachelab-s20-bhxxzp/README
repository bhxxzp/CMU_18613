This is the handout directory for the 15-213 Cache Lab. 

************************
Running the autograders:
************************

Before running the autograders, compile your code:
    linux> make

Check the correctness of your simulator:
    linux> ./test-csim

Check the correctness and performance of your transpose functions:
    linux> ./test-trans -M 32 -N 32
    linux> ./test-trans -M 63 -N 65

Check everything at once (this is the program that Autolab runs):
    linux> ./driver.py

Files:

# You will handing in these two files
csim.c			Your cache simulator [You must create this file]
trans.c			Your transpose function(s) [Starter version included]

# Tools for evaluating your simulator and transpose function
Makefile		Builds the simulator and tools
README			This file
cachelab.c		Required helper functions
cachelab.h		Required header file
contracts.h		Optional header file (from 15-122)
csim-ref*		The executable reference cache simulator
driver.py*		The cache lab driver program, runs test-csim and test-trans
test-csim*		Tests your cache simulator
test-trans.c	        Tests your transpose function
ct/                     Code to support address tracing when running the transpose code
tracegen-ct.c		Helper program used by test-trans, which you can run directly.
traces/			Trace files used by test-csim.c
